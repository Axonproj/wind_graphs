At the moment this file reads wspd_gst.txt.

Change it to take one arg: a date in yyyymmdd format.

Construct two filenames:

1. yyyymmdd_forecast_bramble.json
2. yyyymmdd_actual_bramble.csv

the json file contains the forecast wind and gust data for Bramble Bank for the given date.

the csv file contains the actual wind speed and gusts recorded on the day in question.

Modify the file I gave you to read these two files and plot the wind data. Plot wind as a solid line and gusts as dashed lines. Make the forecast lines green and the actual lines blue.

The csv file contains times for 27/10/2025, but the graph shows them in November.

===

Rotate the time lables to make them easier to read
Label the Y axis "Knots"
Make "Speed" to the end of the title
Add a right hand Y axis in beaufort and shade the beaufort zones

==========

write a perl script that does:

Gets $today, $yesterday and $tomorrow in yyyymmdd format.

for yesterday:

If data/${yesterday}_bramble_actual.csv doesn't exist then:
 Get yesterday's actual wind data from bramblemet

make variables $day_of_month $month_name $month_abbreviation $yyyy then do this:
 
curl https://www.bramblemet.co.uk/archive/$yyyy/$month_name)/CSV/Bra${day_of_month}${month_abbreviation}$yyyy.csv | awk -F',' '{printf "%s,%s,%s,%s\n", $1, $2, $3, $5}' > data/${yesteraday}_bramble_actual.csv

for tomorrow:

get the forecast for tomorrow:

if data/${tomorrow}_bramble_forecast.json doesn't exist then

./get_forecast.sh

the script takes no args.

Print informative messages about whether the files exist, errors, etc.
